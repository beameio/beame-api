## Steps to take before running the example:

1. [Quick Start with Beame.io SDK](https://github.com/beameio/beame-sdk#quick-start)
2. `git clone https://github.com/beameio/beame-sdk.git`
3. `cd example`
4. `npm install`
5. In `index.js` change `var devHostname` with Hostname you got by email when creating a developer
6. Run it with `node index.js`.
7. In console output you will see something like:  
`Server started on: https://nv2ks74ctb95xsdo.v1.p.beameio.net`

8. Go to web brower and direct it to your new secure web server by copying https://*hostname* from console output  
That's that. You have your own https server running on your local machine, available from all over the world :)
